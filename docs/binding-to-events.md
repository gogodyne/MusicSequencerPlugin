## Binding to Events

There are multiple event types to subscribe to.

*   **Song** Beats, which includes the bar number
*   **Track** Audio Level, for all **Tracks**
*   **Track** Play State, such as fading in and out

Events bound to a **Song** reference will report from that **Song**.

Events bound using the **Music Sequencer Subsystem** will report from all **Songs**.
